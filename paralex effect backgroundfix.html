        <p>Disneyland, amusement park in Anaheim, California, featuring characters, rides, and shows based on the
            creations of Walt Disney and the Disney Company. Though its central building, the Sleeping Beauty Castle, is
            modeled on Germany’s Neuschwanstein Castle, it is an unmistakable icon of American popular culture.
            Disneyland is the only Disney theme park designed and built under the supervision of Walt Disney.By as early
            as the 1940s, Disney had begun planning themed experiences to complement his Burbank film studio: a backlot
            tour that would include a train ride through a “village” set and an amusement park that would cater to his
            employees and their children. By 1952 he had formed WED Enterprises, a corporate entity created to plan and
            build the amusement park on studio grounds. Eventually, he chose a plot of land in rural Anaheim, close to
            Los Angeles, for the park instead, largely as a result of the hostility of Burbank city officials toward the
            studio project. This much larger plot allowed Disney to reconceptualize his park into the public “giant
            movie set” that would become Disneyland.</p>
        <p>
            Financing the endeavour proved difficult, but Disney was able to secure a significant portion of the funding
            from the American Broadcasting Company (ABC); ABC received in return the rights to produce a weekly Disney
            television program and a share of the park’s profits. Construction began on July 21, 1954, and was completed
            on July 17, 1955.

            Disney’s disposition toward nostalgic sentiment and fantasy is evident in the park’s design and
            construction. The themed areas originally opened in Disneyland were Main Street, U.S.A., evoking a
            Midwestern American town at the turn of the 20th century and modeled on Disney’s hometown of Marceline,
            Missouri; Fantasyland, based partly on stories from Disney animated features; Adventureland, a jungle-themed
            area; Frontierland, featuring the Mark Twain Riverboat; and Tomorrowland, an optimistic vision of the
            future. Subsequent additions were New Orleans Square, based on the southern U.S. city of New Orleans; Bear
            Country, later renamed Critter Country, featuring the Country Bear Jamboree and the Splash Mountain ride;
            and Mickey’s Toontown, a colourful world modeled on cartoon animation. A short-lived Holidayland existed
            from 1957 to 1961. The Anaheim property also holds a sister park, Disney’s California Adventure, which
            opened in 2001; a separate shopping, dining, and entertainment area called Downtown Disney District; and
            three hotels.

            The concept for Disneyland began when Walt Disney was visiting Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his
            daughters Diane and Sharon. While watching them ride the merry-go-round, he came up with the idea of a place
            where adults and their children could go and have fun together, though his dream lay dormant for many
            years.[11][12] The earliest documented draft of Disney's plans was sent as a memo to studio production
            designer Dick Kelsey on August 31, 1948, where it was referred to as a "Mickey Mouse Park", based on notes
            Disney made during his and Ward Kimball's trip to the Chicago Railroad Fair the same month, with a two-day
            stop in Henry Ford's Museum and Greenfield Village, a place with attractions like a Main Street and
            steamboat rides, which he had visited eight years earlier.
